# NUREMICS® _Labs_

**NUREMICS is an open-source Python framework for developing software-grade scientific workflows.**

🧠 Code like a scientist — build like an engineer.<br>
🧩 Modular workflows — no more tangled scripts.<br>
🧪 Parametric exploration — configuration over code.<br>
💾 Full traceability — everything written to disk.<br>
🛠️ Industrial mindset — R&D speed, software rigor.

## Foreword

The **NUREMICS** project is organized into two complementary repositories:

- [**`nuremics`**](https://github.com/nuremics/nuremics):
This repository is the core Python library. It provides the foundational components to create modular and extensible software workflows.

- **`nuremics-labs`** _(current repository)_:
This repository contains examples of end-user applications built using the **NUREMICS** framework. It is intended to be **forked** by developers to initiate their own `nuremics-labs` project and build custom applications tailored to their specific use cases.

Developers are encouraged to treat `nuremics` as the core engine, and to use `nuremics-labs` as a starting point for developing and maintaining their own scientific software applications built on top of the **NUREMICS** framework.
