    Insert an image into a matplotlib Axes, preserving its aspect ratio and plot limits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_path : str
        Path to the image file.
    fig : Figure
        Matplotlib Figure object (used to force rendering).
    ax : Axes
        Matplotlib Axes where the image will be inserted.
    alpha : float, optional
        Transparency level of the image, by default 0.5.
    scale : float, optional
        Scaling factor for the image size relative to fitted size (default is 1.0).
        Values < 1 reduce size, > 1 enlarge.
